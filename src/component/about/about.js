          Hello! I'm <strong>Mya Htut Khaung</strong>, a passionate junior web developer
          who loves turning ideas into real, working websites. I specialize in
          both frontend and backend technologies including Laravel, PHP, React,
          JavaScript, and MySQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy building clean, user-friendly interfaces and writing code
          that's both powerful and maintainable. I'm always curious and excited
          to learn new things in the world of web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy exploring new tools, working on side
          projects, or spending quality time with my loved ones.
        </p>
